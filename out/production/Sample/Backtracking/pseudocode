1. Backtracking

-> Choices
when we have just N = 1
then,
1 , 2, 3----9

when we need n = 2
meaning two digit number
then,

N = first second
     0-9   0-9 choices but in this case 01, 02, 03 -> it will not satisfy two digit requirement
     so,
     first second
     1-9     1-9

     1       1    this is not possible
     1       2    yes so always 1 and next number should be in increasing order not dercreasing or even equal
     1       3
     1       4

     2        0    no
     2        1    no
     2       2     no

     2       3   yes since its increasing
     2       4
     2       5  goes on

     8       1   no
     8       9   yes rest will be no

  -> number of choices is large
