1. A situation where I had to learn something new and deliver with a deadline.

During my time at my second company, I faced a challenging project where I had to learn
and deliver something entirely new within a tight deadline. As a native Android developer,
I was tasked with integrating the newly launched Theta 360 camera, which had limited documentation,
 into a hybrid mobile application using the Cordova plugin in the Ionic framework.
 This integration was specifically for Android tablets.

The project was critical as the camera integration was for construction teams in the US,
including a team from Gartner, and the iOS developer in the US depended on the Android integration being completed first.

I tackled this challenge by thoroughly researching the Theta 360 SDK,
collaborating closely with my supportive team, and systematically testing across different Android versions on tablets.
Regular check-ins with the iOS developer ensured alignment and timely issue resolution.

Through persistent effort and effective communication, I successfully integrated the Theta 360 camera within the
deadline, significantly benefiting the construction teams.
This experience enhanced my technical skills and ability to adapt to new technologies under pressure.
