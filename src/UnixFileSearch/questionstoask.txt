Scope and Requirements:

Primary Functionality: "What are the primary functionalities that the File Search API should support?"
Criteria: "What search criteria should the API support? For example, should it handle searching by file extension, name, size, or date?"
Constraints: "Are there any constraints on the search, such as performance requirements or limitations on the size of the directories?"
File System Structure:

File Types: "What types of entries will the file system contain? Are there only files and directories,
or are there other types of entries?"
Hierarchy: "How deep or nested can the directory structure be?
Should the solution handle very deep or very large directory trees?"
Search Criteria and Filters:

Criteria Complexity: "Should the search support complex criteria, such as combinations of AND, OR, and NOT conditions?"
Dynamic Criteria: "Do you expect the search criteria to change frequently,
and should the design be flexible enough to accommodate new criteria easily?"
Implementation Details:

Programming Language: "Is there a preferred programming language or framework for this implementation?"
Data Structures: "Are there any specific data structures or design patterns you recommend using for this solution?"
Performance and Scalability:

Performance Requirements: "Are there any specific performance requirements or benchmarks that the solution should meet?"
Scalability: "How should the solution handle scalability, particularly with very large file systems or many concurrent search requests?"
Edge Cases and Error Handling:

Edge Cases: "Are there any specific edge cases that the solution should handle, such as empty directories, large files, or restricted access files?"
Error Handling: "What level of error handling and logging is expected? Should the API handle and log errors such as missing files or permission issues?"
Output and Reporting:

Search Results: "What should the output of the search look like? Should it be a list of file paths, file objects, or some other structure?"
Reporting: "Should the API provide any additional reporting or metadata about the search process, such as the time taken or the number of files searched?"
