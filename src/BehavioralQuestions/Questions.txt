1. A situation where I had to learn something new and deliver with a deadline.

During my time at my second company, I faced a challenging project where I had to learn
and deliver something entirely new within a tight deadline. As a native Android developer,
I was tasked with integrating the newly launched Theta 360 camera, which had limited documentation,
 into a hybrid mobile application using the Cordova plugin in the Ionic framework.
 This integration was specifically for Android tablets.

The project was critical as the camera integration was for construction teams in the US,
including a team from Gartner, and the iOS developer in the US depended on the Android integration being completed first.

I tackled this challenge by thoroughly researching the Theta 360 SDK,
collaborating closely with my supportive team, and systematically testing across different Android versions on tablets.
Regular check-ins with the iOS developer ensured alignment and timely issue resolution.

Through persistent effort and effective communication, I successfully integrated the Theta 360 camera within the
deadline, significantly benefiting the construction teams.
This experience enhanced my technical skills and ability to adapt to new technologies under pressure.


2. Tell me about a time you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.

Situation
As a research analyst, I was tasked with developing an application to monitor pill consumption
for Alzheimer's disease patients. The goal was to accurately track whether patients took their medication.

Task
My objective was to cTell me about a time you gave a simple solution to a complex problem.reate a system that could detect whether a pill was present, absent,
consumed, or not consumed by analyzing video footage.

Action
Data Collection: I recorded 10 videos using an iPhone, capturing different scenarios of pill consumption.
Data Preparation: I extracted frames from the videos, resulting in 200 training images and 60 testing images.
Data Annotation: I annotated the images into four classes (Tablet_Present, Tablet_Absent, Pill_Consumed,
Pill_Not_Consumed) and converted the data into TensorFlow-compatible tfrecords.
Model Training: I trained a MobileNet SSD model using TensorFlow 2.4, running 14,000 steps on a CUDA GPU.
Validation: The model achieved 92% accuracy on the collected images with a 95% confidence threshold.
Web Application: I developed a web application using Node.js to capture video and predict pill status,
integrating IBM Cloud for data storage.

Result
The solution was highly effective, achieving 92% accuracy and significantly reducing labor costs for hospitals.
 Our work was published in an ISJCT paper, demonstrating the potential of AI applications in healthcare.
